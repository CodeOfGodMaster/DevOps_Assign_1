<h1>‚öôÔ∏è DevOps Engineer Assignment 1: Serverless Data Pipeline with Automated CI/CD</h1>

This repository presents a fully automated cloud data processing pipeline leveraging **Jenkins CI/CD** and **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. The pipeline is designed to process files stored in AWS S3 and maintain data reliability using a dual-path storing mechanism.

---

## üéØ Project Goal & Functional Scope

The objective of this assignment is to build a serverless deployment workflow that:

‚úî Automates AWS infrastructure provisioning  
‚úî Containerizes the data processing application  
‚úî Deploys and triggers the logic through AWS Lambda  
‚úî Implements a fault-resilient data storage flow  

### üåê Functional Flow Summary

The application performs the following:

- Reads incoming files from an **Amazon S3 Bucket**  
- Tries inserting extracted records into an **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) database**
- If database insertion fails, the metadata is redirected to the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**

‚úÖ This ensures **no data loss** and consistent metadata record-keeping

6Ô∏è‚É£ Attached **proof of working deployment** such as logs and screenshots

<h2>üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Design</h2>

The Jenkins pipeline is built to eliminate circular dependency issues (Lambda requiring pre-built ECR image). It executes in four major stages:

**Stage 1 ‚Äî Terraform Initial Apply**  
Provision foundational AWS resources including:  
‚Ä¢ ECR Repository  
‚Ä¢ S3 Bucket  
‚Ä¢ IAM Execution Role  
‚Ä¢ RDS Subnet Group  
‚õî Lambda skipped intentionally until the image is ready  

**Stage 2 ‚Äî ECR Login**  
Authenticate into AWS ECR to allow pushing Docker images  

**Stage 3 ‚Äî Docker Image Build + Push**  
Build the container image locally ‚Üí Tag it ‚Üí Upload to ECR  

**Stage 4 ‚Äî Final Terraform Apply**  
Deploys the Lambda function now that the image exists in ECR  

üîÅ Ensures seamless infrastructure + application rollout

---

<h2>üìÅ Repository Structure</h2>

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Jenkinsfile** | Controls CI/CD flow including Terraform + Docker actions |
| **main.tf** | Terraform provisioning for RDS, Lambda, ECR, S3 & IAM roles |
| **imp.py** (Python App) | Logic for S3 ‚Üí RDS data insertion + Glue fallback |
| **Dockerfile** | Builds a Lambda-compatible lightweight image |

---

<h2>‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Resources Created (Region: us-east-1)</h2>

Below resources are provisioned via Terraform:

- **Amazon ECR Repository** ‚Üí `devops-e2e-app`  
- **Amazon S3 Bucket** ‚Üí `akshay-devops-pipe-10252025`  
- **RDS Subnet Group** ‚Üí `terraform-20251025083740891100000001`  
- **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** `instance`  
- **IAM Role** `AdministratorAccess`  
- **AWS Lambda Function** ‚Üí `s3_to_rds_glue_lambda`

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Execution</h2>

<h3 align="left">Prerequisites on Jenkins Agent</h3>

### ‚úÖ Jenkins Agent Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure the Jenkins build environment includes the following:

- A functional **Jenkins server** with pipeline support enabled  
- Installed and configured **AWS CLI** and **Terraform** tooling  
- **Docker Engine** installed and the daemon actively running  
- An AWS IAM role or user with permission to access:  
  * ECR, Lambda, S3, RDS & Glue services  
- Stored **AWS credentials** inside Jenkins Credentials Manager under the ID: `aws-credential-id`  
  *(Used by the pipeline to authenticate into AWS)*  

---

<h3 align="left">üöÄ Executing the CI/CD Pipeline</h3>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard and create a **New Item** ‚Üí select **Pipeline**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Under configuration, choose **Pipeline script from SCM**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set **SCM** to **Git** and provide this repository URL:  
   `https://github.com/CodeOfGodMaster/DevOps_Assign_1.git`  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Define the branch specifier as: `main`  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Save the configuration and click **Build Now** to trigger execution  

---

Once triggered, the pipeline will:

- Clone the code from GitHub
- Run Terraform in a two-phased deployment
- Build + push the container image into **Amazon ECR**
- Deploy the **AWS Lambda** function using the pushed image

The Jenkins job will fetch the latest code and run all four pipeline stages, seamlessly handling both infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.
